## My process

I start by looking at the challenge and building from the outside in, creating the HTML structure and the sections that the project will have to do.

I started with the desktop layout as I wanted to practice GRID, which was challenging as I usually use flexbox (although I ended up using it for the mobile layout).

Using Javascript was also a challenge, I learned how to use the fetch API and how promises work.

I hope you liked my work, I learned and understood many things in this challenge!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- GRID
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- HTML DOM
- Fetch API
